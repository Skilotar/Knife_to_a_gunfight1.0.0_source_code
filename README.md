# Knife_to_a_gunfight1.0.1_source_code
The opensource code for my Gungeon Mod

IMPORTANT DETAILS
I do not claim full ownership of my code as I have used snips from other modders to learn via example.
I actively encourage other modders to take peices of what they might need from here.
There are many refrences in this pack to culture and other I am not claiming ownership of the refrenced material only paying tribute to it. 
Last But most importantly, There are items in my Unfinished/Unfunctional that I do plan on getting around to creating and I would super appreiciate if their concepts wern't stolen
in the mean time.
